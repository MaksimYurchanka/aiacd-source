# AIACD Core (Layer 1) - Orchestration Layer

This project implements the Orchestration Layer (Layer 1) of the AIACD 4-layer architecture, serving as the strategic core that analyzes tasks, selects optimal implementation approaches, and tracks token efficiency metrics.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Analyze task requirements and determine optimal implementation strategies
- Select and manage templates for different task types
- Track token usage and calculate efficiency metrics
- Evaluate implementation quality across multiple dimensions
- Communicate with the Integration Layer (Layer 2) via API client
- Visualize performance metrics and efficiency gains

## Implementation Focus:
- Task analysis algorithms for complexity and requirement extraction
- Template selection and management system
- Token tracking with efficiency calculations
- Implementation quality assessment
- Layer 2 API client with comprehensive error handling
- Metrics visualization for efficiency gains

## Current Priorities:
- AIACD Core Client implementation for Layer 2 communication
- Streaming integration for real-time updates
- Template management functionality
- Token metrics analysis and visualization
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing for all Layer 1 â†” Layer 2 communication
